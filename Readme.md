# ObservePoint Full Stack Technical Assessment

**Thank you for your interest in ObservePoint!**

In Utah, it’s pretty common for your first “interview” to be a
programming assignment that you complete on your own time. So, the
following is a little project that we request that you complete.

## HR System

Contained in this repository is a barebones, empty Java API and an Angular application.
It is intended to simulate a small HR system.

### Instructions

1. Fork the repository
1. Complete the assignment
1. Respond to your hiring manager with a link to your repository

### API

Develop CRUD endpoints to manage departments and employees in
a company.

The java application is preconfigured for an in-memory H2 database.
Create relevant tables and data for testing your endpoints.

Provide some level of unit test coverage.

### Angular

Add routes to manage the employee and department entities available from the API.

Provide one other route that does something interesting with the data.
Suggestions might include joining the data, using charts, etc.
